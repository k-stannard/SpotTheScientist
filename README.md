# SpotTheScientist
First project using ARKit by following Paul Hudson's Swift on Sundays.

This app is made with the following:
- ARKit
  - Used for image tracking for pictures of a select number of scientists
- SceneKit
  - Used to display information about the scientist next to the image being tracked
- Codable
  - Used to decode the json file containing the information about each scientist
